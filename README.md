=====================
To meet the requirements of AI-Driven Personalization and Data Analytics, I have created a Python script that covers several important aspects such as Personalized Recommendation Systems, Data Processing and Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Real-Time Data Handling.

The script includes implementations for:

    Personalized Recommendation Systems: Using collaborative filtering.
    Data Processing and Cleaning: Handling large datasets, data transformations, and preparing them for analysis.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating statistical insights and visualizations.
    Real-Time Data Processing: A framework to integrate with real-time data tools like Apache Kafka or Spark (for now, a placeholder function).
